        "######This research (*Phase 2*) includes semantic communication implemented by using a combination of deep neural networks (NNs) and physical channel simulations. Using \"Robustness_Transfer.py\" (file from Phase 1) semantic encoding is performed using a DualModel (Roberta tokenizer). The preprocessed data is passed through a channel encoder (with a physical channel simulation) to test the robustness of the system under different types of noises. The channel decoder NNs with neural noise channel simulations is used to decode the semantic representations and calculate the BER values. Performance is measured by evaluating the BER values found under different noise conditions. <br>\n",
