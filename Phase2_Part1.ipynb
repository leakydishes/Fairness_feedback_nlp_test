        "###### In Phase 2, SemCom is developed to minimize semantic errors and optimize transmission efficiency. Extending the findings of Phase 1, we assess different models including DistilBERT, untrained/trained RoBERTa, and the custom DualModel. The focus is on exploring semantic relationships using the trained RoBERTa model. Implementation involves a fusion of neural networks and physical channel simulations, necessitating a thorough data pre-processing. In Phase 2, we embark on two pivotal endeavours. Phase 2 Part 1 kicks off with an extensive exploration of the DistilBERT model and tokenizer, meticulously preparing the text attribute (comment text). This entails precise tokenization and sequence truncation to seamlessly integrate with the library's maximum input length.  <br>"

If I remember, what I used to do was acknowledge the deaths of the 14 women whenever I raisied such a sensitive issue, which didn't make any difference at all because I was speaking with people who only saw one side to the issue and did not even want Marc Lepine's name mentioned, ever again.   Yes,  I  agree that the harm done to the children in residential schools was abominable.  But I don't agree that that was the original, so malicious intent.

When performing that operation, \"child\" is not entirely an honest locution, though its users may be sincerely unaware that they are finessing a legitimate question.   One consequence of using more semantically neutral medical terms, such as \"fetus,\" is that they preserve the void in our knowledge, rather than papering it over with the assumptions that accompany words like \"child\" and \"baby.\" \"Fetus\" requires further thought and discussion, while \"child\" pretends there is no legitimate ground for further thought or discussion.

The enemy surrendered, the war ended, and Russia had no \"need\" to invade further.   Which brings an important but most often overlooked theory.  If Truman had waited just a couple of more weeks before dropping the 2nd bomb, Japan would have surrendered anyway. No need for the 2nd bomb.

Compliance with a subpoena that involves a large volume records request means you have to show that you put a procedure in place that would to the best of your ability find all the in-scope documents within the timeframe. That is what the Clinton team did. But in such large volume cases it is not unusual that the procedure might miss a few, nor is it criminal if it does. Which is why there were no charges. You think a Republican Congress wouldn't have held her in contempt of Congress for non-compliance if they could have? That alone proves you wrong on this point as well.\n",

If a person lives where there is no trails--they hike in the woods and make new ones .  They catch a bus that takes them to a park.  We have over 100 parks in Anchorage with the Chugach park nearby containing thousands of acres . There is no reason to ride on our roads.  Bike trails were built to get bikes off the roads.  Taxpayers were sold the bonds to make them for this reason. The city even had a law on the books that said where ever a bike trail was close--bikes must use it and not the road.  years ago bikers quietly got that law removed.   I personally saw a guy on a bike get run over. The victim churning around under the truck was something that will live with me forever . I wouldn't wish that fate on my worst enemy.  That is why I urge bike riders to stay off the roads . If you had seen what I did---you'd feel the same way.\n",

The statement \"diversity is our weakness,\"  is expressed every day, repeatedly, in the G&M comments to stories on immigration and First Nations.   It may be phrased in coded language, but the sentiment actually represents a large segment of people who comment on stories. So, no, you are not a small beleaguered group of  truth soldiers battling the powerful majority on the left.  Anyone, anywhere in this country can say \"diversity is a weakness.\" It's called freedom of speech.

I had friends on both sides of the war; some died, others protested.  SDS was prominent at UofH and Professor Lee was one of its leaders.  I do remember Professor Lee doing a debate with William F. Buckley and that was a mistake for Lee as Buckley was a great debater.  However, the Vietnam War did show that we lost thousands of young people needlessly as the war should have and could have ended a lot sooner.  When politicians are the deciders of our young people's lives, it's always the young people who lose.  More recently, we were told of mass weapons of destruction in Iraq which proved to be a total lie.  I trust people over 40....I just never will trust a politician.\n",

While it is of course correct to call a fetus a child, \"child\" carries with it the association of personhood, and so ensoulment. In effect, that lends tacit semantic support to a view that the Church does not officially hold, that a fetus is in fact an ensouled person, indistinguishable on those counts from you or I. When performing that operation, \"child\" is not entirely an honest locution, though its users may be sincerely unaware that they are finessing a legitimate question.   One consequence of using more semantically neutral medical terms, such as \"fetus,\" is that they preserve the void in our knowledge, rather than papering it over with the assumptions that accompany words like \"child\" and \"baby.\" \"Fetus\" requires further thought and discussion, while \"child\" pretends there is no legitimate ground for further thought or discussion.

But, I have been reading about the arguments going on in Australia re gay marriage and the wildly round-about approach their national government is taking to determine if the people want to approve of it.  Of course, all kinds of national polls say an overwhelming majority of people do support legalization of LGBT marriage.  The \"round-about approach\" is designed to make it difficult for that truth to be shown.  Especially since those who oppose gay marriage are saying that approving gay marriage means a loss of religious liberty.  Here is another story on this subject that you might find interesting, informative, and helpful in debunking this absurdity of equating legalizing gay marriage with debunking religious liberty:  https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/14/marriage-equality-paul-kelly-churches-lgbti-rights-david-marr?CMP=soc_567\n",

Here's another theory (I confess, it's my own): the 2nd bomb was dropped because America didn't want Russia (Communists) to expand any further into Chinese territory. The enemy surrendered, the war ended, and Russia had no \"need\" to invade further.   Which brings an important but most often overlooked theory.  If Truman had waited just a couple of more weeks before dropping the 2nd bomb, Japan would have surrendered anyway. No need for the 2nd bomb. Not because American forces would \"storm the beaches\"--they didn't have to!  Resistance to the Russian advance from Manchuria was crumbling.  Japan would have surrendered just to stop the slaughter of what was left of its forces--not to mention the civilian population.\n",

This is evident in the Accuracy (0.767) and Precision (0.761), where only 76.7% of predictions were correct and when the model predicts a comment as a positive sentiment it was only correct about 76.1%. Capturing the specific patterns in the dataset for training is important for SC fine tuning, DistilBERTs size was limited in capturing understanding over extensive spans of text, limiting its performance. This is evident in the Recall (0.767) where the model correctly identifies 76.7% of actual positive sentiments, however F1 score (balance between mean of precision/ recall) indicated to be a good balance (0.763). Note, this DistilBERT model was trained using 1/50 of original CSV file, when increased to 1/6 overfitting occurred, further analysis is required to understand plausible applications."

No court can realistically address this latest EO because all of the denials are not in America but on foreign soil. So stop wasting precious Hawaiian tax money on meaningless challenges. DO HOWEVER focus on real problems like what should Shatz Hirano Gabbard and Hanabussa be doing in DC to address the N.Korean missile threat to Hawaii. That is more significant than some politician with an inflated ego attacking the president. The possible and likely death dealing attack from N.

That effort has always failed on a Constitutional level.  And since the Constitution is their eternal stumbling block, they are now making a case to our unelected bureaucrats to get the job done.   And while those in favor of the Constitution will say that cannot happen, the Left have nothing to lose by trying.    So in other words, It won't matter whether or not reasonable law abiding citizens can make a connection.  All that will matter is whether or not the left can pull enough unreasonable persons(law abiding or not) to buy into it,: After all its fairly clear the Republic is all but gone, and a Democracy is now in session, and those with the most votes wins.\n",

Right now the USA are acting as terrorists in Syria as well......but that is too much for you to see I guess.\n",

In this case, they didn't know the full story until they got to the scene, and it sounds like they gave the 9-1-1 caller an earful for misleading them.   I think the police did the right thing here -- had the \"shots fired\" call turned out to be a hostage situation or a mass shooting and they only sent 2 or 3 cops, you (and everyone else) would be criticizing them for not having a proper response. But the police in this town get criticized for *everything* they do, even when they preserve public safety, citizen's rights, and everything turns out ok.\n",

So how does this compare to other states.  I would say it is considerably higher than anyone is willing to pay in income or sales taxes.  We are an underpopulated state, a very large disjoined land mass state, and a state with a high cost of living.  We do not have enough population to support the kind of government outlined in our State Constitution without a golden goose like oil.  Alaskans are facing a massive fiscal problem if the oil runs out, and it is running out.  In four more years we are going to see the biggest bust this state has ever seen.  If Alaska could develop its natural resources on federal and state land without the impediments from the environmentalists we might have a chance, but that is not going to happen.  With Hillary leading by 5 points in the polls we are doomed.  The Democrats are our nemesis.\n",

We choose their career path and make them follow it. That way the number of women in science programs will be equal to the number of men, and then you can appoint equal numbers!   Of course, the more likely alternative is they'll just find some incompetents and appoint them solely based on their gender.

Stated differently, I think the generation of Catholics who entered the 1980s as adults and as parents had been formed in a Vatican II ecclesiology which taught that they had rights and duties as members of the church. If they were still deferential to the clergy, they were less so that their parents were; if priests were still on a pedestal, the pedestal was lower and the parents of victims were willing to take down the priests who harmed their children. The post-Vatican II parents were less willing than earlier generations to go away in silence. Vatican II taught them to think and act as adults in the church, and many of them took that teaching seriously.\n",

Signs are most likely to inform public of the danger and possibly helps the land owner from liability lawsuits. Obeying laws/rules starts at a young age, I cannot believe seeing kids in passenger seats with parents making left turns into a school parking lot with multiple NO Left Turn signs in sight. Every morning kids are being taught this disrespect lesson, as long as there's no HPD it's okay to do at Pearl City Highlands. This is INSANITY on the part of parents who blatantly disregard rules in plain sight of their kids. It's SAD the majority of these rule breaking parents are of the Democratic Party in Hawaii. Democrats do what they think is right, it's not about following rules/law written in the books or posted on traffic signs.\n",

Tools to solve this problem are: 1)  Cutting expenses - This is being addressed and expenses have been reduced and will continue to be reduced.  However, achieving \"billion dollar\" expense reductions is unlikely.  Those who suggest this as the major component for solving the financial crisis have simply not looked at where the State spends money.  Nor have they identified which programs or services should be eliminated.  2) Spending Reserves - Reserves could be used to close the gap this year but would do nothing to solve the underlying problem.  Next year the problem would only be bigger.  And this solution could result in a downgraded credit rating for the State which will increase State spending. 3) New Revenues -  The most obvious choices are restructuring the Permanent Fund to generate general fund revenue, increasing existing taxes, or imposing new taxes.    Because of scale, the Permanent Fund must be part of the solution.\n",

Let's examine David Schwantes sick actions. Schwantes was a elementary school teacher who made boys touch his private parts. Schwantes actually groomed the boys. Schwantes worked on a highly manipulative level. Child molesters have to be highly manipulative because they know what their doing is wrong. And if your doing sick sexual stuff to children in the elementary school you work in, well you improve up, so to speak, your manipulative behaviors.   David Schwantes was convicted of sexually abusing two children. Well there are two that came forward.   Schwantes got a 2 yearsentence.  And he got to keep his retirement.   Schwantes was sentenced a year ago.   Schwantes should rot in jail, but he'll probably get out early cause his family and friends think he is a outstanding guy, even while he was raping children.

Should the persons most impacted by a governmental decision be accorded \"extra\" attention regarding their opinion on the issue.  On the county level for example, should the opinions of the residents on a road where a rock quarry is proposed be given more weight than the views of other Lane County residents who might live fifty miles away and be completely uniimpacted by that quarry? Should the residents and homeowners in a Eugene neighborhood proposed to be \"up-zoned\" from R1 to R2 or R3 have more \"say\" than persons clear \"across town\" or out in the boonies as I am?    Your earmuff \"solution\", is, I hope, tongue in cheek.  You mention a \"whiff of classism\". This brings out a bit of irony.  The residential areas most impacted by those trainhorns are working class neighborhoods.  Their complaints re: train horns have been ignored for years.

The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice.  According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001.

For a Christian to justify the death penalty morally is to go against the sure belief that God is love. And, as we've agreed, God does not kill those whom he loves. And he loves all. Therefore we must love all. Practically in one respect, that means aspiring not to kill them.  Which brings me to Bin Laden, on a purely human level, I'd have shot him, nursed him back to health, and then shot him some more. And so on, ad infinitum if possible. But that's me ('I', of course.

Those options include talking to the alleged bully, having him or her sign a harassment cease-and-desist order or possibly suspending the bully\" BS is what I call.  My child was bullied ALL THROUGH school and you guys DID NOT DO ANYTHING.  \"Sending a clear message\" is a joke in itself.  WHY DO YOU BOW DOWN TO THE BULLY school district?  Take action.  The steps above are not an action, its you sweeping the issues under the mat and not dealing with it.  I would never EVER send my child to public school again if I were given a do over.

Getting it fixed is not optional. Therefore, health care does not respond to normal market forces, and so should be in the public sector.\" Of course people don't want to shop for health care at the time they become sick or injured. Because they're cost conscious, in a free market they'd plan ahead and shop before they become sick or injured. Some business would specialize in this type of product. Health care does respond to market forces, but in order for it to work properly, we have to get government out of the way.\n",

We could easily change this law to make it possible for those who contribute to the economy and who do not break laws to regularize their status, so that they will no longer be without it.   If we had a rational, humane immigration law, then we would, once again, experience something that is called \"circular migration, ie people coming here to work for a number of years and then returning to their home countries, able to buy land or start a business with the money that they made here.

The other issue that is not well addressed is the issue of automation. Let's take the concept of self-driving vehicles and the potential of 3 million trucks drivers being out of work in 20 years. If that is the case then the workforce will be shrinking anyways.  Trump can't admit publicly that those jobs will not be coming back or that he will not achieve 3% annual growth or that even if he did, that type of growth does not create the same type of employment levels as it did in the past. Thus, the option is to shrink the labour pool in the short term to make it seem like his base is getting more jobs.\n",

He found that many of the attendees simply didn't understand what she was saying. Over the years, Clinton had acquired the Silicon Valley, TED way of talking which sounded like verbal babble to many Americans. This is why Donald Trump doing rallies of simple slogans and promises was a big hit.\n",

Also, they're not a burden and better overall if company (or public service) allows a \"third party\" to manage DB pensions. Teachers and HOOPP are two excellent examples. The added bonus of this is that the company can't get there hands on pension money and abuse it, lose it, or go bankrupt. In the PS case, taxpayers are not on the hook if the pensions are mismanaged or experience a big lose. DB are the best way to go because the majority of people don't know enough about investing.\n",

Remembering Obama's words, it's a mindset we must work together to change. It is the mindset that, when we hate someone, then there is a straight line to the world letting us kill them. Or, more directly in this story, when someone has treated us so badly and indifferently that we hate him, then it is ok to incinerate a young woman who is taking her child to the doctor, just because the torturer and the woman with her child share a construct that we call \"nationality.\"  It's a mindset our generation must change ... a good way to think about it\n",

The law was thought to be unjust and it was changed. Similarly with laws related to homosexuality. People simply started to ignore them, so they were changed. Same with the issue of marijuana. Because something is written into law does not make it \"just\", even if the decision comes from the mouth of the Supreme Court itself. People don't need to be told by lawyers what is right.

The rest of us paid with higher food and gas prices. And the low interest policy fueled borrowing which has become a significant problem for Canada.  And of course it hurt anyone wanting to travel to the US or purchase goods online from the US. We need our dollar back near par where it should be. Regardless of Trump we should be moving to an open free market North America with a single currency. Of course that would put Poloz out of a job.\n",

Only when there is a campaign to collect more revenue from the oil industry so that we get the fair value of OUR resources does that become a point of concern it seems. ACES was doing just fine and we were able to set aside $17 Billion in the CBR. It was doing so well in fact that Parnell campaigned on keeping it in place. He lied of course as politicians often do and by April of the following year the entire tax structure that had so benefited Alaska was thrown out and replaced with the enormous gift to the oil industry. As he signed the bill into law Parnell warned about the massive loss in revenue it would cost the state and called for belt tightening to make up for the loss.  That same legislature did not tighten the belts but pushed forward the mega projects and Tajmahawkers.\n",

I'll leave the first issue to the lawyers, although it seems that a strong case can be made that it at least places unnecessary burdens on our right to express ourselves.  On the second, it leaves us with a city that doesn't enforce its own laws except in rare cases. This makes people feel singled out when enforcement is directed at them and also makes it nigh on impossible to mount a challenge that changes the code, since it affects almost no one (even when many are violating it).  Who's going to call in the contractor neighbor who built a liveable \"shed\" in his back yard? Sure, it's sub-code by definition since it didn't get the permits that are required, but the city's ability to keep complaints anonymous isn't to be trusted, so there goes your relationship.

He never even bothered to meet with his Commission until the victims had quit out of frustration.  he knows how to speak, how to listen, and there's no shortage in the laity with suggestions.  I think it's more he doesn't WANT to have to listen, because he knows he won't like what he hears: the old structure is doomed.  As to not acting yet, with each one of these reports (Australia, Guam and the steady parade), the church loses ever more credibility, ever more of its laity, ever more of its numbers.

Not sure if they have a death wish or just plain careless or indifferent.   In any case, the area around Oakway Shopping Center is difficult for drivers: entering, trying to find a parking space, and exiting on one of the main roads.  The same is true for Valley River Center where it's a nighmare for bicyclists or pedestrians. Eugene needs to rethink it's safety measures for Shopping Centers.  Currently, shopping centers are dangerous to one's health, either on foot, bicycle or driving because of the poor planning allowed by the city and developers.\n",

He says, \"Modifying human DNA in ways that could be passed on to future generations has long been deemed ethically out of bounds.\" He's referring to scientific methods of DNA editing of course. But it's worthwhile to point out that modifying DNA and passing it on to future generations is what higher-order life-forms do. Not for us the single cell reproduction of bacteria and yeasts. We like to mix it up, and reap the myriad benefits of that kind of reproduction.  Every time a man and woman unite to create offspring, it's a genetic experiment involving the modification of human DNA. Unexpected things can happen, sometimes with negative consequences. However we don't even restrict procreation much less prohibit it. We prefer to learn as much as possible about any drawbacks procreation may have, and warn people accordingly. It seems reasonable to use the same general approach for DNA editing.\n",

The space program depends on total cooperation between all nations, and astronauts leave from, and land in, territory of the former USSR. It has been built, piece by piece by the representatives of many nations, and it is the belief of many scientists that we will not head out to the stars without the cooperation and expertise of all nations on Earth.  Despite this, our fearless leaders play games of one-upmanship against each other. Of course the Russians tried to interfere in our elections, as the USA did when Boris Yeltsin was elected.

Your experience might be different, but when I was growing up it was a lot easier to get pot than it was to get alcohol or cigarettes.   These ideas that legalization and regulation somehow leads to MORE crime and MORE abuse by children is completely unfounded. It is precisely these reasons that I want to see it legalized and regulated. I'd rather isolate the problem to a few people who abuse it rather than throw in danger to children, black market crime, and gangs. I'd like to see the police focusing on bigger issues. Pot, compared to hard drugs, is minor - not to mention how much better it is for pain management and a variety of other uses.  If my father didn't have pot to manage his pain he'd go back to opioids and die. I'd rather see adults use it recreationally over children. I know you mean well, but I don't agree with your approach.

Not only Prime Minister Rajoy's statements did not leave the Nation breathless, but  most Spaniards did actually criticize him and his Government for taking so long in enacting Article 155 to stop the nonsense coming from Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist cohorts!  Section 2 of the Spanish Constitution states 'The Constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards.' Most Spaniards are unhappy with the Catalan vote on separation, where 1) non-separatist Catalans refused to participate; 2) many separatists voted several times+many other irregularities; and 3) the rest of Spain was not consulted! Since Catalonia is an integral part of Spain, a clean vote on separation would involve: 1) amending Section 2 of the Spanish Constitution; and 2) All Spaniards (not just Catalan separatists) would have to vote on it. Good luck with that, Mr. Puigdemont!\n",

A UO law student came to my office after hearing a lecture about the contamination and told me: you will be the 1st Eugene Realtor to know about this. I had been buyer's agent for a few homes in the area, called clients who purchased and asked if they wanted to sell, I was willing to not charge a listing fee. Nobody wanted to sell so I assume problem not judged too onerous; they had more SF for $ there than elsewhere.  It was perplexing, many Realtors did not seem aware of the issue. But if they knew, Realtors are not supposed to advise sellers completing a seller disclosure (required for those who have lived in homes & for non occupant owners; regs have morphed through the years). If sellers didnt recall that they had rec'd a govt. letter, many probably did not complete SDS line accurately. Silicone Valley buyer amassed a foot high stack of documents but still closed deal.\n",

Most natives are too busy getting on with living and the minority that are suffering are facing the same problems that natives at the low end have faced for generations.  Unemployment and substance abuse - usually on a backwater reserve - still lead the hit parade.  But we get the same tired rhetoric.

These lawyers, ever since the bedrock case of Boyd vs. U.S.(circa. 1885) which instructed government to back off, has introduced warp minded doctrines and false assumptions to wean us off the milk of liberty; nourishment our children, flanked by armed cops in their schools, on the streets, in the access ways of court houses, airports, etc., have never tasted.

Our reality is that  medium sized manufacturers rely on the US market.  Shipping our products across the ocean simply makes no economic sense. Freight costs. China ?  Ship to China?  A sad joke. We will never get reciprocity with China. I am an investor , and  have been harshly schooled to look at the downside of any scenario. A 15-25% import duty means breakeven, 35% we close our doors. Canada , while a wonderful place, no denying it, is an expensive place to do business. Faced with raw power , used to its fullest extent, I fear we may be faced with some scenarios that sit oitside our imagination currently, but are not hard to contemplate. Currency union?  Mandatory military spend?\n",

Mark Reynolds hitting so well and Cargo not really forced the Rockies to play Desmond in the OF since he has that versatility, but his legs never held up. Rockies missed the boat on not trading away Cargo last offseason.

It will hit low and middle income people the hardest, with no way to exempt essentials like food and medicine.  It is unconscionable that the Legislature is single-mindedly focused on the very tax that the voters soundly rejected months ago, and is a very troubling reminder how powerful the public employee unions are, as this tax was their creation in Measure 97.  We don't need a new type of tax. There is no way to make it fair to business, no matter how many different tax rates you define. And it is just as subject to business cycles as any other tax.  Reform the taxes we have: corporate and personal income taxes. Make millionaires pay their fair share of personal income tax by establishing new top tax rates.  Low and middle incomes have stagnated. Don't tax them more.\n",

If half of immigrants are homeowners, I'd like to know how many in that number are from the 2004 cohort. We know over 50% of them live in the GTA and Van. You can't buy any sort of property in these regions on $33,000/yr.  Perhaps Doug is referring only to the 50% of more recent immigrant households that have one or two university-degreed breadwinners. That would mean less than 25% of recent immigrants. I wonder how many of these folks had money from outside Canada to help them purchase? And, what's happening with the other 75%?  In the 1960s, the % of home ownership among immigrants was higher than for non-immigrants. That % has declined steadily since, and increasingly, most immigrants require more years in Canada to reach ownership, if they attain it at all. http://geography.uwo.ca/faculty/mok/paper/immigrants.pdf\n",

High speed rail (HSR) will facilitate the movement of people along this important corridor much better than highway 401 and planes. High speed rail can carry more people more efficiently than cars can. Link HSR with major regional airports such as London International and Waterloo and non stop flights will follow; relieving pressure on Pearson. HSR is great for medium distance such as Toronto and London. Local service can connect smaller centers such as Brantford, Woodstock, while the express service would connect the major cities in this corridor. London (500,000) Kitchener/Waterloo/Cambridge(500,000). That's 1 million people. Next should be Toronto to Quebec City. Three hundred kms per hour is money worth spending. It's about time Canada joined other G7 countries and have some form of HSR.\n",

I don't know any other program with such a poor set of QB choices, though I'm slow to criticize Helf because these guys were well-rated by many, many other \"experts.\" I guess there's just a lot of luck involved and it seems, considering the incredible and unprecedented number of serious injuries last year, that Helf may be one of the least lucky individuals in the coaching ranks. It'll be interesting to see where he lands, though with his golden parachute, he's probably in no hurry. I bet he's having some hard times coping with his dismissal; he had to expect at least another season to put it all together. For me, I was against his firing but now accept I was wrong: Taggart has shown that the poor recruiting was a measure of incompetence on Helf's part. However, undaunted, I reserve my spot in the Monday morning QB chair.\n",

I predict he will say as little as possible now, and then if called to a vote between now and September 30, will quietly vote FOR it, as he has been instructed to do.   I would love to be wrong on this one, but I'll bet I'm not.  He needs to be voted OUT, based on the fact that he puts party before people.        No one with a conscience could vote for the Graham-Cassidy bill.  It gives governors around the country the right to DENY coverage to people in their state with pre-existing conditions, and to reduce/cut off medicaid.  In other words, poor people and currently sick people will DIE.  Gardner, if you vote for this piece of garbage, I will vote and donate against you in both primaries and the next election.    Prove me wrong.  Don't be a partisan coward.\n",

Additionally, were you more familiar with competition regulation you would understand the difference between regulation of horizontal versus vertical relationships. There is a clear difference between morality implied by economic models (utility maximisation) and human ethics, such as compassion and empathy, which divide is the subject of centuries of debate (and in my book). Your insistence that they are the same thing (\"inseparable\") is your vision of the world - that all society's decisions should be based on the maximisation of economic utility.

For January, the FAS established an imported volume of 23,362 m³ for Germany worth $5.48m; the constructed value per unit thus amounted to around $235/m³. 24,008 m³ worth $6.19m was recorded for March, equating to a unit price of $258/m³. Only the import figures for February given as 501,143 m³ and worth a total of $2.62m are not plausible this would put the unit price at only $5.2/m³. On the basis of the average, constructed import value for January/February, the volume imported from Germany in March would amount to roughly 10,100 m³.  Owing to the inconsistencies in imports from Germany, the total import figures established by the FAS for Germany (+452% to 689,599 m³) cannot be compared with those of last year either....

Let's face it, there really are not that many good jobs on Kauai. Mrs. Tokioka took a competitive job, and has handled herself well against major public onslaughts to the company she currently works for. It would only serve her well to do an impeccable job on the water commission (recuse herself if/when necessary) to support her current and any other careers she would pursue on Kauai.

All I could buy in the health insurance market was Obama care. There were no options to choose from only gold or silver plans from providence. Now to go to the doctor we have to satisfy a 6500$ deductible per person before the insurance co. pays a dime. My Obama-care plan cost 1637$ per month and my old plan my employer paid for was just shy of 1400$ per month. Great deal??? I am looking forward to something better from Mr. Trump. Even if we went back to what I had it would let us go to the doctor which now we can not do due to the fact we can not afford the deductible.\n",

Kids who grow up there have a big advantage in accessing local employment opportunities because they can live at home or can get \"loans\" for down payments and other financial help from parents who have in most cases benefited hugely from the housing boom. At the same time, the government has been letting our 300,000+ annual immigrants settle where they wish, and most of them want that to be Toronto. This is inflating demand for housing in TO and driving prices even farther beyond the reach of kids from rural and small-town Canada. No wonder they're stuck where the opportunities aren't.\n",

Article II, Section 2 clearly provides that the President, and the President alone, nominates judges. The Senate is empowered to give advice and consent.” -Mitch McConnell(States News Service, May 19, 2005)  Now, this statement by Mitch McConnell back in 2005 is strikingly at odds with his current statement that the Senate should refuse, without any actual consideration of the merits, any nominee by Obama.  On the other hand, his 2005 statement was the result of a Democratic action to prevent conservative nominees from being appointed. I think the only slight difference is that their action was because they felt the nominees were too extreme... Obama hasn't even made a nomination yet.\n",

Minimum wage rules set a floor for jobs that require no specialized skills. These jobs will start to disappear if the minimum is set to high. Business will have to either cut costs in other areas or raise prices in order to pay for higher paid low skill workers. It's pretty simple. The notion that a higher minimum will \"float all boats\" because of more money sloshing around is unproven.   This explanation doesn't even take into account job losses, as other posters have pointed out, from AI and automation. Higher minimums could speed up certain businesses adoption of low skill job killing investments.\n",

But if you buy the building, like with the TajMahawker, all of these costs are in addition to the square footage price.  The \"independent analysis\" conveniently overlooks this fact.  Plus the analysis is using the Atwood office rate of today.  In years to come it should be much lower to reflect market conditions as we enter a recession due to low oil prices.

            "Interesting that Helf picked Marcus but all other QB choices, except Herbert (probably) were busts. It's a long list of high-ranked guys who left after disappointing. I don't know any other program with such a poor set of QB choices, though I'm slow to criticize Helf because these guys were well-rated by many, many other \"experts.\" I guess there's just a lot of luck involved and it seems, considering the incredible and unprecedented number of serious injuries last year, that Helf may be one of the least lucky individuals in the coaching ranks. It'll be interesting to see where he lands, though with his golden parachute, he's probably in no hurry. I bet he's having some hard times coping with his dismissal; he had to expect at least another season to put it all together. For me, I was against his firing but now accept I was wrong: Taggart has shown that the poor recruiting was a measure of incompetence on Helf's part. However, undaunted, I reserve my spot in the Monday morning QB chair.\n",

MNB is preferred for NLP tasks when categorical classification is used as is assumes set words are conditionally independent, estimating probability based on Bayes rule [15], whereas DT and RFC can handle noisy data, DT makes decision based on inputs recursively splitting input data into subsets to find a condition (however this is prone to overfitting) and RFC improves performance based on different subsets using a bootstrap sampling (decision tree to find final predictions). K-Nearest neighbours of new data points, uses labels most common class among its neighbours as the predicted (label), (preforms well on smaller datasets, however sensitive to choose of distance metric K). It is evident that RFC (85.54%) resulted in the strongest prediction rates, this could be due to its ability to interact with patterns from text leading to higher accuracy.
